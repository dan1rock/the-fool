# THE FOOL

# Description

Objective:
The objective of "Durak" is to avoid being the last player remaining with cards in hand. The game is typically played with a standard deck of 36 cards, but it can also be played with a full 52-card deck.

Setup:

1. Shuffle the deck thoroughly and deal six cards to each player. Place the remaining cards facedown in a draw pile, with the top card turned face up next to it.

Gameplay:

1. The player to the dealer's left goes first and the game proceeds clockwise.
2. The active player is called the "attacker," while the player to their left is the "defender."
3. The attacker selects one of their cards and plays it face-up in the middle of the table, announcing its rank (e.g., "Ace of Spades").
4. The defender must then play a card of higher rank or the same rank from their hand to defend against the attack. If the defender cannot or chooses not to defend, they must collect the attack pile into their hand.
5. If the defender successfully defends, the attack pile remains in the middle, and the next player to the left becomes the defender.
6. After defending, the defender can choose to attack the player to their left by playing a card from their hand. The attacker can then defend as before.
7. If the defender cannot or chooses not to attack, they must draw cards from the deck until their hand has six cards again.
8. Special card rules:

- Trump suit: At the beginning of the game, the dealer determines a trump suit or rank. Cards of the trump suit/rank outrank all other suits, allowing them to win against any non-trump cards.

- "Fool" card: If the deck includes a "Fool" card, it is usually designated as the highest-ranking trump card.

- "Attack" and "Defense": When a player successfully defends an attack, their defending card remains on the table as part of the attack pile. The attacker can continue to play cards on top of the attack pile, making subsequent attacks stronger.

- If the defender successfully defends against all attacks in a round, the attack pile is discarded, and the defender becomes the next attacker.

End of Round and Winning:

1. The round ends when the draw pile is depleted, and one player runs out of cards in their hand.
2. The player who is left with cards in their hand at the end of the round is the "Durak" (the fool) and receives a penalty.
3. In subsequent rounds, the player to the left of the previous attacker becomes the new dealer.
4. The game continues with multiple rounds until a predetermined number of rounds or a point limit is reached. The player with the fewest accumulated penalties at the end of the game is the winner.
